	*How do you run the failed test cases in selenium?
	-Selenium doesn't have this feature but Testng provides this feature that if i only want to run only the failed test cases
	 there is a option available, it will record all the test failures and it will maintain in an seperate xml file
	 called Testng-failed.xml.
	
	
	Parallel Execution
	   -Local System
	   -Remote Execution
   
	 We can assign Threads for:-
	 
	1)Test - Cross Browser //(testng.org/documentation-main.html)
	   
    Here the test is same but only running in different browsers with help of Parameters.
   	The moment u have cross browser it is mandatory to use parallel = tests, for this need to 
   	understand concept of parameters without which we can never achive cross browser.
   	
   	TestNG allows you to pass an arbitrary number of parameters to each of your tests using the `@Parameters` annotation.
	
	There are three ways to set these parameters:-
	The testng.xml file
	Programmatically
	Java system properties
	
	If you are using simple values for your parameters, you can specify them in your testng.xml.
	DATA PROVIDERS:-
	Specifying parameters in testng.xml might not be sufficient if you need to pass complex parameters, or parameters that
	need to be created from Java (complex objects, objects read from a property file or a database, excelfile, csvfile, 
	jsonfile,xmlfile, javaobjects etc…​).
	In this case, you can use a Data Provider to supply the values you need to test.A Data Provider is a method on your
	class that returns an array of array of objects. This method is annotated with @DataProvider.
	
	If no parameter named "db" is found in your testng.xml file, your test method will receive the default value specified
	inside the @Optional annotation: "mysql".
	
	@Parameters("db")
	@Test
	public void testNonExistentParameter(@Optional("mysql") String db)
	{
	    //more code
	}
   					  
   *Parameters using xml will used for cross Browser.
   *Parameters using Data Providers will used for Data Driven Tests.
    
   2)classes - Without Cross browser // classes are not dependent on other class so we can run in 
   									  parallel.When ever we are declearing a variable at class
   									  level(global) and we are having a scenario where we have
   									  to take variable data from previous tests then continue, then paralle ="methods" don't 
   									  give proper results, then we have to go for parallel="classes".
   	public class ParallelExecutiion
	{
	     String Customer_id;
	     
		@Test
		public void test1()
		{
			Customer_id = driver.findElement(By.xpath("")).getText();
			Reporter.log("test1 executed", true);
		}
		@Test()
		public void test2()
		{
			Customer_id.Contains("420");
			Reporter.log("test2 executed", true);
		}
   	}
   	
   3)Methods - Without Cross browser // parallel execution of methods is not recommended when methods
                                      are dependent on each other, in that case go for parallel
                                      execution of classes, coz classes are not dependent on eachother
                                      Parallelism helps only when u have Independent tests or modules. 
   									  Even in dependency on groups u are not allowed to run in parallel.
   									  In such case run dependent and independent methods seperatly. 
   									  
   	*Recommendation vm's are costly, it takes lot of space only for browser execution u don't need vm, u can do same 								  
	 thing with the help of container, container hardly takes 150mb to 200mb they are very fast, light weight u 
	 just need the browser to execute.
	 
	*if 10 methods on a priority of 1 to 10 are run in parallel execution then here the threads will not
	wait , will run but will get inconsistency results and they wil be a conflict, in official documentation
	these points are mentioned that when ever u have priorities, "dependency on method" and "dependencies
	on groups" its not recommended to run in parallel, coz u purposefully created these dependencies. In this
	case u can go with parallel = classes.

Q)Difference b/w DataProvider and DataProviderclass?
A)they both r helping us to perform datadriventest,DataProviderclass is only needed when r maintaining all the data provider
  in a seperate class.
  
Q)why maintaiping two files excel and properties,why not put all data in excel file?
Best practise is to shouldn't mix everything, testdata is something different for different cases.
 Cofiguration is specific to project, i don't need to change very often, but testdata might change
 for different test cases.
 
 
 *PageObject model is a design pattern(certain rules and best practises) that help u to write ur automated test in a clean manner
  which enhance test maintainence and reduce the code duplication.
  -A page object is an object oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT.
  -This can be done in two ways:-
   1)Standard page object model without using pre-defined class.
   2)With pre-defined class avaliable in selenium called page factory, it is specially designed
    in selenium to support page object model,it is fine even if u don't use it.
  -Page objects themselves should never make verification or assertions.This is part of your test
   and should always be within the test's code, never in an page object.The page object will contain
   the representation of the page and the services the page provides via methods but no code related
   to what is being tested should be within the page object.
   
Q)Difference b/w @FindBy, @FindBys, @FindAll.

*A frameWork is a set of rules, concepts and practices that needs to be followed.
 --Something similar to the syntax of a programming language.Syntax sets the rules. In a testing framework it could be the
 standard with which a test class needs to be designed or a standard which should always be followed to perform test logging.
 --see slides.
 
 Myths In the Market:-
 1)Creating frame from the scratch or use Exitising FrameWork, existing framework means they are set of people who r talanted
  they long time from the industry, they have created the repository or project, in java its a pure github repository which
  they can expose as a Jar file we can use directly.
  
 --Popular frameWorks available in the market:
  1)Serenity BDD
  2)karate
  3)selenide
  4)Halenium
  5)katalium
  6)easyrepro
  7)Katalon
  8)TestProject
   .etc
 -Here in these frameworks they is no full control,minor changes we can make but can't change the whole skeleton or customize it.
  like Once u buy a house and u can't break the walls and customize it.
  
  Q)Are u comfortable that if u have to build everything from scratch, have u created any framework,how comfortable u r 
    while creating a framework or making the changes in the existing framework.
  A)ur ans should be yes.u should never say that yeah i all ready had a framework i was just contributing little bit, i was
    making some changes.Nobody wants u are not capable of building a framework.Always say i know how to design a framework,
    also i have designed a framework.
    
  Q)Do we need a single framework for Web,API, Mobile..etc?
  A)yes, but they is no hard and fast rule.For Web we are using Selenium, for API we are using RestAssure, for Mobile we r
  Using APPium. so if u notice few things are standard,Reports will not change,utilites will not change,few things will change
  that how u invoke the test in Web & in Mobile, but api is a different set of libraries we need, so they is no fix rule.
  Karate framework it self supports Web,API,Mobile & Desktop ,her u don't need to maintain multiple frameworks, karate is the
  best example.
  				yes one framework can have all, but if u want to build dedicated framework u can do but obviously u have to
  maintain 3 projects i.e..3 frameworks.But Serenity,Selenide,Halenium,Katalium uses plain Selenium Framework.
  
  Large Org.
  Q)In my company i have a dedicated team who builds the framework, and other teams maintain.If there is a large organization
   they seriously wants to take the benifits of automation,they have team generally they call these as CAT team or Automation
   Team(AT) or Central Development team(CDT) ,they only focus on the Framework development,enhances and maintainance.The main
   Purpose the team is develop the framework,enhancement and maintainace.
   																		  They will build the framework,and provide a Library
   or Jar file or a dependency, once u get the dependency all the team members or all the different teams they can start using
   this framework.Let framework name is Selenium Test Automation FrameWork(STAF1.1) or any name.If any team needs facing 
   any issue, or needs any module they can ask this CADT/COE/AT/CAT team.
  
  Small/Medium Org.
  If u have a small or medium scale or if u are just starting with automation u might not need a dedicated team, so in the same 
  team few resources will be working on the automation,few resources will be working on the manual testing and few resourcs
  will be doing both.
  					  So this framework we are creating this can be use by all team members so is it possible that we can
  expose this to the outer world something call public framework so that everybody can use.They is something call Public 
  repositories & Private repositories. public repos can be exposed to public,private repos are designed for specific client
  or company that can't be shared.
  
  Q)Who decides which framework to follow, which design pattern to follow & what other best practices?
  A)5+, 7+ experienc people
  
  Q)how much time it takes to build a minium framework?
  A)its a never ending process.For building basic skeleton using maven and execute using jenkins it needs 3/5hrs, but once
  the skeleton is ready u have to keep on adding the libraries.
  
  Q)Should we go with the paid verison or free version?
  A)For paid versions u have a upper hand,u will get a support so that u can ask a question that this feature is not working
  i need the fix by evening or by nxt week.Lets say tomarrow u get a requirement that u need to build a system where u need
  to show the Test Status from last one year,for paid version u will get a paid tools which maintains the logs history, but
  for the free tools u have to come up with the ideas. 
  											For free verisions u are taking the open source library u are building everything
  from the scratch so u r the one who fix it. $1000 per month/per user, so here comes the management involvment, u have to set
  with the manager, this is the cost & involved u have to show & this is the return on investment(ROI) which we can get.If
  u don't show the ROI no body will pay u for the tool cost.
  
  Q)DO we need to learn any frameWork in current market.?
  A)U joined a team there r using this framework in that case u can learn.But just for the job change not required,if u r 
  still interested go with serenity.
  
  
  What is Build?(build tools maven, gradle)
  A)Set of tasks like Compile, create a executable file,jar file,deploy, execute test, delete directory,each task will perform
  certain activity these tasks when u combine as a set of task is called build.it can be a custom task or predefined task.
  Build for devlopers is like code compilation,unit test,create package, deploy.Until all the tasks are not completed the
  build will not come under success.
  													In automation case we use these build tools to trigger our automated test
  In our case when i say execute my test build it means i want to run my all xml files, and even a single test failed my build\
  will fail.Maven says how do i know which xml/how many xmls to trigger,we tell it by maven surefire plugin in POM.
  
  Q)which command & plugin use in maven to execute ur test?how do u create a build in maven.?
  A)MVN test, maven surefire plugin.We create a build by adding a build tag and a surefire plugin.we run this build via ecplise
  ,via command line interface(CLI),in real time we need cli to run in any location.mvn -version,mvn install,mvn test,change
  ur directory to ur project directory by cd users/....when i say mvn test, it checks for dependecies in cache if there r not
  it will download all dependencies,then it will compile & it will run all the tests & i will either get build success or
  fail. To run build in any ci server we need only one command Mvn test.
  																		To build an application we have diff(assembly plugin)
  plugin,to complie we have different plugin,for testing we have maven surefireplugin,to create failsagfe report we have
  failsafe plugin,so one pom.xml have multiple plugin,each plugin is responsible for one goal.Developers have seperate
  project and tester have seperate project,we don't club our code with dev environment for the dev project, coz any small
  change in the plugin can disrupt the complete build,its always good pratice to keep project for automated test.
